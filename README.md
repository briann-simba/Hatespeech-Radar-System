# Hatespeech-Radar-System
Hatespeech Radar is a web application that identifies “hate-speech” content on Twitter streams and records related statistics of posts (safe vs unsafe). When a post is flagged to be ‘unsafe’ (containing potentially hateful message), an admin is notified via SMS of the incident. 
The system:
Allows the user(admin) to log in to the system.
Displays tweets from a specified stream.
Classifies textual tweets as either hate-speech or non-hate-speech.
Displays flagged users.
Sends an admin an SMS message when a post is flagged as hate-speech
